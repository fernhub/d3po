# D-3PO

This fullstack application was developed to allow a user (me) to interact with a pdf through various LLMs without having to spin up multiple tabs and determing how to upload the file, then switch between models across these websites.\
Instead, a user can upload a pdf and then in a dropdown switch between different AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral, all in one place.
